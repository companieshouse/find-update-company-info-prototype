      You previously updated your GOV.UK One Login email address to <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">emailaddress2@example.com</span>. However, another Companies House account already exists which uses this email address. This means you have 2 options:

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Option 1</h3>

<p>Change your GOV.UK One Login email address back to <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">emailaddress1@example.com</span></p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Option 2</h3>

<p>Change your GOV.UK One Login email address to any other email address, as long as it's not already in use for another Companies House account.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">After you've changed your email address, you can come back to sign in.</p>
