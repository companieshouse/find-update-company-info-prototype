<p class="govuk-body">You are receiving this email because Tom Lawrence has told us not to restore your digital authorisation to file online for DEBMAT SURFACING LIMITED. </p>

<p class="govuk-body">This means that if you want to file for this company online in the future, you must use a current authentication code.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you were not expecting this, and you want your digital authorisation to be restored, you should try to resolve this within the company.</p>
