<p class="govuk-body">Jill Edwards's digital authorisation to file online for FLOWERS LIMITED has been removed by Hannah Salt. This means they will no longer be able to file online for this company without a current authentication code.</p>

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "Jill Edwards will still be able to file online for this company if they have access to the current authentication code. An authorised person may wish to change it."
}) }}

<p class="govuk-body">We've emailed Jill Edwards to let them know they are no longer digitally authorised to file online for this company. We’ve also sent an email to the company’s registered email address and to any other people who are authorised to let them know.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If Jill Edwards is appointed as an officer of the company, such as a director or secretary, removing their digital authorisation to file online does not remove their appointment.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you were not expecting Jill Edwards's authorisation to be removed, you must resolve this within the company. Companies House cannot give or remove digital authorisation.</p>
