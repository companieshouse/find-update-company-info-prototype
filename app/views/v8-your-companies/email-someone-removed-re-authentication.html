<p class="govuk-body">Jill Edwards's digital authorisation to file online for FLOWERS LIMITED has not been restored.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This means they:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>cannot file online for this company without a current authentication code</li>
  <li>have been removed from the list of digitally authorised people in your account</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">They were removed by Hannah Salt.</p>

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "Jill Edwards will still be able to file online for this company if they have access to the current authentication code. An authorised person may wish to change it."
}) }}

<p class="govuk-body">We've emailed Jill Edwards to let them know they are not digitally authorised to file online for this company. Weâ€™ve also sent an email to any other people who are authorised to let them know.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If Jill Edwards is appointed as an officer of the company, such as a director or secretary, this does not remove their appointment.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you were not expecting Jill Edwards to be removed without restoring their digital authorisation, you must resolve this within the company. Companies House cannot give or remove digital authorisation.</p>
