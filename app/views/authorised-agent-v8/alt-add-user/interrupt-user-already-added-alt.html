       <p>This could be because they do not have a Companies House account that uses the email address. Or, they may have already been added to another authorised agent account.     sometimes known as 'Find and update company information', 
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If they do not have a Companies House account</h2>

        <p>Ask them to create sign in details for Companies House. To do this, theyâ€™ll need to go to the <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Companies House register (opens in a new tab)</a> and select 'Sign / Register'. This is different to a WebFiling account.</p>

        <p>The user will need to do this before you can add them.  </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If they've already been added to another authorised agent account</h2>
<p>You can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add the user once they've been removed from the other account</li>
  <li>provide a different email address</li>
</ul>
